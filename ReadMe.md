# NodeJS Exmaples

A little portfolio for NodeJS.  While the [Silly Votes](https://github.com/michaelbrockphd/silly-votes) repository demonstrates NodeJS and other NodeJS packages, this focuses on my attempts to make my own Node Modules.

It is also here attempts are made to try and learn some TypeScript and using Node Script to transpile for me.  As I have found the hard way, when JavaScript is brought up, TypeScript is never far behind.

As a new module/projected is added, attempts will be made to try and keep this ReadMe file current.

## nodejs-matrix

Effectively a re-implementation of my [Golang Matrix Module](https://github.com/michaelbrockphd/golang-example/tree/master/matrix) but in TypeScript.

Originally, it did start in the newer versions of JavaScript but after seeing the number of interfaces in the Golang repository, it made sense to also learn TypeScript here.

Just to be clear, I am more than experienced in working in Vanilla JavaScript (OO desing, MVC and even KVM from the ground up that I learned for iOS when it was still Objective-C), but now is the perfect time to learn TypeScript rather than build in JavaScript now and build yet again in TypeScript.

Overall, this module has virtually the same classes thus please see the [Golang Matrix Module](https://github.com/michaelbrockphd/golang-example/tree/master/matrix) repository for details.  The only difference is this version has better error handling that should be implemented in the Golang version (D'OH!).
